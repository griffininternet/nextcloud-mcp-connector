"""The administration form of BL-06: five values a store installation needs.

Built like :mod:`mcp_connector.exapp.settings_form`, which is the one to one model for the
transport, the app context and the error model. Four things differ, and they are the whole
content of this module: a second form id, ``section_type: "admin"``, a filled ``fields`` and
the fact that the values of this form do reach the ExApp.

That last point is the reason this form exists at all. AppAPI's ``SetValueListener`` stores
the value of an *admin* field with
``ExAppConfigService::setAppConfigValue($app, $fieldId, $value)``, so the field id is the
configuration key, without a prefix, and :mod:`mcp_connector.exapp.config_values` reads it
back over the very channel the data key already travels. The field ids are therefore taken
from ``config_values.CONFIG_KEYS`` instead of being written a second time, and a test holds
that equality: a form whose ids drift from the read path is a form whose values nobody reads.

**Two traps, both verified in the source of the components we do not own.**

* ``sensitive: true`` at a field makes the ``SetValueListener`` encrypt the value with
  ``ICrypto`` before storing it, using the server secret. The ExApp then reads back a blob it
  cannot open, so a value it needs at runtime would be lost behind a flag that looks like
  hardening (T-05-05). None of the five fields carries it, in any spelling.
* Declarative Settings have no button type. The complete list is ``text``, ``password``,
  ``email``, ``tel``, ``url``, ``number``, ``checkbox``, ``multi-checkbox``, ``radio``,
  ``select`` and ``multi-select`` (nextcloud/server stable34,
  ``lib/public/Settings/DeclarativeSettingsTypes.php``). This is why the destructive action of
  this phase is an occ command in plan 05-06 and not a knob in this form.

The security hint of BL-06 lives in the description of the ``oauth_dcr`` field itself, not
only in ``docs/oauth-setup.md``: an administrator reading a switch is the one person who can
act on it (security domain V14, T-05-06). The same rule is why both switch descriptions name
the coupling between them: ``registry.client_policy`` reads the metadata document way as
"this switch AND the registration switch", and a form that shows two independent checkboxes
for one derived answer is a form that produces a state the code never has.
