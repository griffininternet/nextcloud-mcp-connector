"""The four admin values of BL-06, read out of the ExApp configuration of Nextcloud.

Three facts carry this module, and each of them is measured rather than assumed:

* **The read channel is the one this repository already runs.** ``oauth/crypto.py`` fetches
  the data key of this installation with a ``POST`` on
  ``/ocs/v2.php/apps/app_api/api/v1/ex-app/config/get-values`` and a JSON body
  ``{"configKeys": [...]}``. There is no ``GET`` on that resource; the shape was measured
  against a running AppAPI 34.0.0 in plan 03-08. The path and the field name are imported
  from that module here instead of being spelled a second time.
* **The config key IS the field id of the Declarative Settings form.** AppAPI's
  ``SetValueListener`` stores an admin value with
  ``ExAppConfigService::setAppConfigValue($app, $fieldId, $value)``, without a prefix, so
  the four ids of ``exapp/admin_settings.py`` are exactly :data:`CONFIG_KEYS`
  (nextcloud/app_api v34.0.3, ``lib/Listener/DeclarativeSettings/SetValueListener.php``).
* **AppAPI 34 answers in lower case.** The entries carry ``configkey`` and ``configvalue``,
  the column names of ``ex_apps_config`` serialised straight out of the entity. The camel
  case spelling is what the write side takes and what a later version may answer with, so
  both are accepted.

**Why this module fails soft while the data key path fails hard.** An invented data key
looks like it works and silently makes every stored authorization unreadable, so
``crypto._read_key`` raises on every failure. A missing admin value means one thing only:
the administrator has not set anything. Falling back to the deploy environment is then the
correct answer, and stopping an installation over an unreachable OCS call would be the
wrong one. Every failure below is therefore an empty result plus exactly one log line.

**Why a 401 is told and not reported as a fault.** Plan 05-12 measured this read against a
running HaRP topology instead of guessing about it. The channel carries: with the app on
``enabled`` the same call answers ``200`` and returns a value that was set in the form. The
``401`` hangs on one thing only, the activation state, because
``AppAPIService::validateExAppRequestToNC`` accepts the app secret and then refuses over
``!$exApp->getEnabled()``, with ``ex-app/state`` as the only exempt path. The first start
after a deployment is always inside that window (``enable`` comes after ``init``), and inside
it there cannot be an admin value yet. So this one outcome is an INFO line that names the way
out, and every other failure of this read stays an ERROR. What does make a value take effect
is measured as well and unchanged: one disable and enable cycle, which stops and starts this
container (05-12-MEASUREMENTS.md, M1, M2, M3, M3b, M3c).

**Why ``config.normalize_base_url`` stays as it is.** The public address of this app is held
to a harder rule here than that function applies (https, with the loopback exception of RFC
8414), and the rule deliberately lives here instead of in it: the same function validates
``NC_MCP_URL``, the address of the Nextcloud this container talks to, and http on an internal
host is a legitimate deployment there. One shared rule would either break those installations
or leave this value unchecked (CR-01).

The precedence rule this implements, together with plan 05-04 which applies it: admin value,
then the ``NC_MCP_*`` variable of the deploy environment, then the default in code. That is
why :func:`admin_overlay` returns the spelling of those variables and not a settings object:
no signature in the existing code has to change for an admin value to take effect.
