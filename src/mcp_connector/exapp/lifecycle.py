"""The three endpoints AppAPI calls: ``/heartbeat``, ``/init`` and ``/enabled``.

Deliberate deviation from the research sketch, which registered these with the custom
route decorator of the shared server object: they are handed out by a factory here and
attached by ``entry_exapp`` alone. A registration on the singleton would make
``/heartbeat``, ``/init`` and ``/enabled`` appear in the standalone HTTP server of phase 1
as soon as anything imports this module, and D-23 requires that stdio and that server stay
exactly as they were. The cost is one line in ``build_exapp_app``; the benefit is that the
two phase 1 modes cannot grow a lifecycle endpoint by accident.

Three rules that come straight from the AppAPI source:

* ``/heartbeat`` authenticates nothing. Non HaRP daemons send no headers at all, and a 401
  there makes the registration run into its ten minute timeout (pitfall 10). It answers
  ``{"status": "ok"}`` and nothing else, no version, no configuration (T-02-06).
* Every answer carries ``Cache-Control: no-store``. The PHP proxy caches JSON answers for
  3600 seconds whenever the answer does not say otherwise (pitfall 4, T-02-07).
* ``x-origin-ip`` means the request came through the PHP proxy, which does not protect
  these paths and attaches valid AppAPI headers itself. Such a request is answered with
  404 as defense in depth; the primary protection is the narrow route declaration in
  ``appinfo/info.xml`` (pitfall 2, T-02-04).
