"""Deck tools: one browse tool with a level, and one create-only write (D-06, TOOL-04).

**One tool, three levels.** ``deck_browse(level=...)`` walks boards, stacks and cards.
Three separate tools would cost three slots in every client that limits them and three
schemas in every ``tools/list``, for navigation the model can express in one enum value.
The answer envelope is the same on every level (``level``, ``count``, ``results``), so the
model learns one shape instead of three.

**No N+1, by construction.** ``GET /boards/{id}/stacks`` already contains the cards, so
``level="cards"`` is exactly one HTTP request no matter how many stacks a board has. Asking
each stack for its cards separately would re-fetch a payload Deck already sent, and a unit
test counts the requests so it stays that way.

**Two things are explained before they can fail.** A missing Deck app stops both tools at
the capabilities check, before the first Deck request (SRV-04). And a user whose Nextcloud
forbids board creation is checked against the board's own permissions instead of being
walked into a 403: ``canCreateBoards`` governs new boards, not cards on an existing board,
so the honest question is whether *this* board grants an edit permission (threat T-01-63).

Deliberately absent: update, delete, board or stack creation. The client below has no code
for any of it, which is what makes the create-only annotation of ``deck_create_card``
honest rather than a promise (threat T-01-62).
