"""Prefixed resource IDs, encoded and parsed in exactly one place.

``fetch`` is the only caller that has to route an ID back to a resource type, and a
malformed prefix there resolves a card as a note without any error. One codec plus a
roundtrip test makes that class of bug testable.

Formats::

    file:<fileid>
    note:<id>
    card:<boardId>:<stackId>:<cardId>      (short form card:<cardId> is accepted)
    event:<calendarUri>:<objectName>
    mail:<databaseId>                      (the databaseId of the message, and no other
                                            number: one message carries uid, remoteId,
                                            messageId and, in the full answer, id as well,
                                            and all four of them address nothing here)

                                            that same conversation: a Talk search entry
