"""Registration of the mail tool. The logic lives in :mod:`mcp_connector.tools.mail`.

``level`` is a ``Literal`` and therefore an enum in the input schema, not a free string: the
model sees the three valid values instead of guessing "inbox" or "folders" and paying a round
trip for the correction (D-06, D-14).

The tool is listed unconditionally, even on an instance without the Mail app. A credential
dependent ``tools/list`` is not cacheable, breaks the token budget gate and surprises clients
that persist tool lists; the honest answer to a missing app is the sentence the tool returns
(SRV-04).

Empty strings are the defaults instead of ``None``, so no ``anyOf`` of string and null reaches
the schema; the body below turns them back into ``None`` before the call.

One tool and no second one, which is the whole security statement of this family: there is no
send, no draft, no move, no flag and no delete here, and the full text of a single mail travels
through the existing ``fetch`` with ``mail:<databaseId>`` rather than through a tool of its own.

The full filter grammar stands in ``README.md`` and in the runtime hint of
:data:`mcp_connector.tools.mail._FILTER_HINT`, never in this file: every byte here is paid for
in every ``tools/list`` of every session, a grammar is read once, and a wrong condition costs
exactly one round trip because the refusal names all seven types itself. What stays here is the
short form a model needs to write a condition at all: the level it applies to, the shape
``type:value``, the seven names and the one rule that silently swallows a wrong answer instead
of failing (``start`` and ``end`` are Unix seconds). The earlier wording of this paragraph sent
the grammar into the docstring of the tool "instead of the schema", which was measured wrong in
plan 11-07: a tool description and a ``Field`` description are two keys of the same
``tools/list`` payload, so moving text between them saves nothing and the line break of a
docstring costs two bytes where a description costs none. Only compression is a saving.
