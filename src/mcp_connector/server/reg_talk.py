"""Registration of the talk tools. The logic lives in :mod:`mcp_connector.tools.talk`.

``level`` is a ``Literal`` and therefore an enum in the input schema, not a free string: the
model sees the two valid values instead of guessing "chats" or "history" and paying a round
trip for the correction (D-06, D-14).

Both tools are listed unconditionally, even on an instance without the Talk app. A credential
dependent ``tools/list`` is not cacheable, breaks the token budget gate and surprises clients
that persist tool lists; the honest answer to a missing app is the sentence the tool returns
(SRV-04). The same holds for the administrative send switch of TALK-04: ``talk_send`` stays
listed when it is off, and the answer says who can turn it on.

Empty strings are the defaults instead of ``None``, so no ``anyOf`` of string and null reaches
the schema; the bodies below turn them back into ``None`` before the call.

The docstring of ``talk_browse`` names both truncation keys, and that is the one sentence of it
that buys itself back: ``truncated`` is the cut **page** of the messages level, and a ``next``
stands beside it, while ``message_truncated`` is the cut **text** of a single entry, which no
cursor continues. Before plan 12-01 both were called ``truncated``, and a model that reads the
entry level flag as a page flag pages in a circle, which costs more round trips than the fifty
odd bytes this sentence occupies. Nothing was compressed in return for it, unlike the mail edit
it follows: ``talk_browse`` stood at 858 of the 1400 bytes of ``MAX_TOOL_BYTES`` and the whole
surface at 15657 of the 18000 of ``BUDGET_BYTES`` when the sentence was written, so the room was
already there and neither gate moved (plan 12-01, ``scripts/check_tool_budget.py``).
