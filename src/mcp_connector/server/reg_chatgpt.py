"""Registration of the ChatGPT profile. The logic lives in :mod:`mcp_connector.tools.chatgpt`.

The two tools here are the only ones in this server **without**
``structured_output=False``. That is the documented exception to the schema diet (D-14):
returning a Pydantic model makes mcp 2.x emit the payload twice, as ``structuredContent``
and as JSON text in ``content``, which is exactly what the OpenAI connector reads.

Parameter names are contract and not style. OpenAI's own reference server declares
``search(query)`` and ``fetch(id)``, and a connector that renames either of them is simply
not recognised. ``id`` shadows a builtin, which is why the lint exception below is on the
parameter and nowhere else: inside the package the value travels as ``resource_id``.

The descriptions stay one line each, for the same reason the other thirteen tools have no
output schema: every byte here is paid for in every ``tools/list`` of every session.
