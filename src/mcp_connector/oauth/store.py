"""Everything of this phase that has to survive a restart, in one SQLite file.

**Why SQLite and not a JSON file.** The refresh rotation is a compare and set: exactly one
of two simultaneous redemptions may win, and the loser has to learn that it lost rather
than to overwrite the winner. A file that is read, changed and written back cannot do
that; a transaction with ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` can, in one line of SQL, across threads and
across worker processes on the same volume (pitfall 10, T-03-13).

**Why the standard library module and not aiosqlite.** Every call here runs in
:func:`asyncio.to_thread` with its own connection, which is the whole of what an async
wrapper would add. The dependency surface of this project is a deliberate decision
(``docs/dependency-audit.md``), and a new direct dependency for a thirty line wrapper is
not one worth making.

**Pragmas, set on every connection because two of the three are per connection.**
``journal_mode = WAL`` so a reader does not block the writer of a parallel request,
``foreign_keys = ON`` so revoking a client actually takes its authorizations with it, and
``busy_timeout`` so the loser of a lock waits for the winner instead of failing with
"database is locked" while a user watches a spinner.

**What is stored and what is not.** Tokens exist here only as their SHA-256 hex digest, so
a stolen file cannot be replayed against the server (T-03-11). The two secrets that must
come back out, the Nextcloud app password of an authorization and the poll token of a
running login flow, are encrypted with :mod:`mcp_connector.oauth.crypto` and bound to the
id of their own row, so moving a ciphertext to another row makes it unreadable rather than
useful (T-03-12). Every row object that carries such a value masks its repr.

No module global mutable state: the store is an object that is given its path and its key,
which is the same rule the credential objects of phase 1 follow. Two processes on the same
file are a supported case, not an accident (SRV-05).
