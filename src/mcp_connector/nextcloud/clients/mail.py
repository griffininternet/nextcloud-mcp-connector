"""Mail client: four declared read paths of one app, and no path that writes.

The Mail app answers accounts, mailboxes, message envelopes and one full message below
``/ocs/v2.php/apps/mail/``. This module reads exactly those four and nothing else. Mail is
the most sensitive family this server ever carries, so it is strictly read only, and the
shape of that promise is that the code which could break it was never written.

Both mandatory headers of D-18 are already set by :func:`ocs.ocs_get`, which is why this
module deliberately has no header constant of its own. Tables needs one because its row route
belongs to a generation 1 path that is built directly; every route here goes through the OCS
helper.

Replaceability, and the reason this is the longest paragraph in the file. All four routes in
use stand in the ``openapi.json`` that Mail 5.11.1 ships, and none of them carries
``#[OpenAPI(scope: SCOPE_IGNORE)]``: they are a promised API. Beside them the app has a
second, internal route set below ``/apps/mail/api/`` which the phase 8 spike measured, and
those three listing routes **are** ``SCOPE_IGNORE``, so a Mail release may change or drop
them without any deprecation. They are deliberately not used here. Falling back to them would
be worse in two directions at once. It would trade a declared API for the internals of Mail's
own frontend, and it would make the write prohibition unsayable: ``/api/messages`` is a
resource route, so POST creates, PUT changes and DELETE removes on exactly the path a read
would use, and a path based prohibition cannot tell the four apart. On the declared routes
the send path is a path of its own, which is what makes a prohibition writable and counter
checkable at all. The word ``SCOPE_IGNORE`` is spelled out here because it is the search term
somebody will find this decision under.

The trap of this family is ``limit``. It looks optional, and the app's own OpenAPI
description claims an empty value returns all messages. The controller computes
``min(100, max(1, $limit))``, and ``max(1, null)`` is 1 in PHP 8, so an omitted limit answers
exactly **one** message. :func:`get_messages` therefore takes ``limit`` as a keyword without a
default and caps it here, so a URL without a window cannot be built by construction.

Two statuses mean something on these routes that they mean nowhere else in this project.
**206** on the full message is a success: the message was found and everything but ``body`` is
there, because it could not be decrypted. **500** on the mailbox and envelope routes is the
everyday case of a mail server of the user that cannot be reached, or of a mailbox that was
never synchronised, so the sentence points at that account and not at the Nextcloud log. Both
are handled in this module and not in the shared parser, exactly as phase 9 kept Talk's 304
local: they carry this meaning on these routes only, and a global change would loosen the
rules for every other family in silence.

There is deliberately no send, no draft, no move, no flag, no delete, no attachment download,
no tag write and no trusted-sender path in this module. The server promise is that it can
neither send nor change nor remove anything through Mail, and the cheapest way to keep a
promise is to never write the code that could break it (threat T-10-07). A unit test greps the
**code part** of this file for every one of those paths, with docstrings and comments blanked
out after the pattern of ``tests/contract/test_no_destructive_calls.py``, which is exactly
what lets this explanation name them out loud.

In place of a retry rule, which a module without a write path needs no room for: every full
message read opens an IMAP session inside the app (``clientFactory->getClient``, ``logout`` in
the ``finally``), so a loop over the single message route is expensive. The brute force
counter is not the reason. ``#[BruteForceProtection]`` sits on that controller, but
``throttle()`` is never called anywhere in the ``lib/`` tree of Mail 5.11.1, so the counter
does not count.

MAILBOXES_PATH = "/apps/mail/ocs/mailboxes"

#: One window of envelopes. The path carries the ``databaseId`` of the mailbox and not its
#: ``id``, which is base64 of the IMAP name and a frontend detail; confusing the two is the
#: most expensive mistake in this family.
MESSAGES_PATH = "/apps/mail/ocs/mailboxes/{mailbox}/messages"

#: One full message, addressed by the ``databaseId`` of the envelope. It sits directly below
#: ``/apps/mail/`` and has no ``api`` segment: the ``api`` spelling answers a 404 out of the
#: routing layer and makes Mail look unreachable when it is not.
MESSAGE_PATH = "/apps/mail/message/{message}"

#: Not a parameter, a constant. Without ``singleton`` the controller answers the threaded
#: view, a thread root is not a message, and the two are indistinguishable in the payload, so
#: a caller who got this wrong would read a list of threads believing it to be mail. Same
#: principle as ``READ_ONLY_PARAMS`` in the Talk client: what a caller can get wrong is not an
#: argument.
VIEW = "singleton"

#: Upper bound of one window. The app caps at 100 and answers exactly ONE message when

#: window cannot be built by construction.

#: The full message was found and is complete except for its body, because the body could not
#: be decrypted. That is a success, and it is handled here instead of by widening
