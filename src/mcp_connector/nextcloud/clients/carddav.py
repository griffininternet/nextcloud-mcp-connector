"""CardDAV client: address book discovery and a server side filtered ``addressbook-query``.

Three decisions carry this module.

**The path has a ``users/`` segment.** Address books live under
``addressbooks/users/<uid>/<addressbookUri>/`` while calendars live under
``calendars/<uid>/<calendarUri>/``. The address book root is a plain collection named
``users`` below ``addressbooks``, and the difference is a classic source of a 404 that
reads like "this account has no contacts". Verified against
``apps/dav/lib/RootCollection.php`` and ``CardDAV/AddressBookRoot.php``.

**The server filters, not this process.** The query carries one filter with a
``text-match`` per property and a result limit, so a large address book stays a small
answer (threat T-01-58). Downloading every card and matching locally would be both slower
and less correct: the ``i;unicode-casemap`` collation is the server's job.

**Every request body is built with lxml and every card is read with vobject.** A search
term that contains ``&`` or ``<`` cannot close a tag this way (threat T-01-53), and RFC
6350 escaping, line folding and multi value properties stay with the library that knows
them (D-17, threat T-01-55). There is no XML literal and no regular expression in this
file.

This module only reads. It sends PROPFIND and REPORT and nothing else, which the unit
tests assert by grep: contacts have no write path in this phase (threat T-01-57).
