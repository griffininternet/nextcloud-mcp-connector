"""OCS requests and the two response formats Nextcloud actually uses.

Two headers go out with every OCS request, always (D-18): ``OCS-APIRequest: true`` marks
the call as an API call, and ``Accept: application/json`` asks for JSON instead of XML.
Without the first one Nextcloud answers a browser login page with status 200, which is the
single most confusing failure in this whole API family, so :func:`_json_payload` names it
explicitly instead of dying in ``response.json()``.

Two parsers, not one, and that is the point of this module (pitfall 9):

``parse_ocs``
    for everything under ``/ocs/v2.php``: the payload sits in ``ocs.data`` and the real
    status in ``ocs.meta.statuscode``.
``parse_app_json``
    for Notes and Deck, which are ordinary app routes and answer with the bare object, or
    with ``{"status": 4xx, "message": "..."}`` on failure. Letting an ``ocs.meta`` parser
    loose on that produces a ``KeyError`` where an actionable message belongs.

Status handling is the same everywhere in this project: never repeat a failed
authentication (Nextcloud counts failures per source IP and then throttles every user of
this server), never follow a redirect, and turn a 5xx into a degraded answer rather than a
stack trace.
