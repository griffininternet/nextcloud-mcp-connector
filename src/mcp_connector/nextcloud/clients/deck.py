"""Deck REST v1.0 client: boards, stacks including their cards, and one create path.

The API lives at ``/index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0`` and it is the strictest of the JSON
APIs this project speaks. Two headers are mandatory on **every** request, a plain GET
included: ``OCS-APIRequest: true`` and ``Content-Type: application/json`` (D-18). Without
the first one Nextcloud answers a browser login page with status 200, which is why the
headers are one constant here instead of an argument anyone could forget.

Deck does **not** answer in an OCS envelope. A failure is the bare object
``{"status": 403, "message": "Permission denied"}``, so every response goes through
:func:`ocs.parse_app_json`; letting an ``ocs.meta`` parser loose on that produces a
``KeyError`` where an actionable sentence belongs (pitfall 9).

Version 1.0 and not 1.1 on purpose. 1.1 exists since Deck 1.3.0 and only adds attachment
types, which this project does not touch, so 1.0 is the wider compatibility for the same
functionality.

Three local guards keep doomed requests from ever leaving, because a refused request is
cheaper than a 400 and its message is better:

* ids that go into the URL path must be digits (threat T-01-63)
* a title is trimmed, must not be empty and must not exceed 255 characters (threat T-01-67)
* a due date must be an ISO-8601 timestamp

There is deliberately no update, no delete and no board or stack write in this module. The
server promise is that it can neither overwrite nor remove anything, and the cheapest way
to keep it is to never write the code that could break it (threat T-01-62).
