"""Which optional apps this Nextcloud has, in one round trip (SRV-04).

``GET /ocs/v2.php/cloud/capabilities`` reports Notes, Deck, Tables and Talk including their
API versions, for Deck whether the user may create boards at all, for Tables whether the app
is enabled and for Talk the chat length limit of the instance. That is one request instead of
a try-except around every tool call, and it is the difference between "the Notes app is not
installed on this Nextcloud" and a stack trace.

Five optional apps are checked here, and one of them is answered through a different channel:
Mail publishes no capabilities section at all, so its question is put to the navigation of the
signed in user instead (:data:`NAVIGATION_PATH`). That second request is only paid by callers
that actually use a Mail tool, it is filled into the very same cache entry, and it exists
because the alternative is worse: without it a missing Mail app arrives as status 998 in the
404 branch of the shared status mapping, which tells the model to "search for it first", that
is, to search a message in an app that is not there.

Calendars and contacts need **no** app: CalDAV and CardDAV live in the core ``dav`` app, and
the Calendar and Contacts apps are only their web interfaces. The honest check there is "does
a collection exist" and it belongs to plans 07 and 08, not into this module.

The cache is a pure latency optimisation and may be empty at any moment (D-20). Nothing in
this project becomes incorrect when it is cold, and it holds no session state: the key is
base URL plus user name, the value is a snapshot of public app metadata, and no credential
ever enters it. ``tools/list`` stays static regardless of what this module reports, because
a credential dependent tool list would break caching, the token budget gate and every
client that persists tool lists.
