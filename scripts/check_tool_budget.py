# therefore never protects anything, which was the state until the end of phase 1.
#
#   Measurement 2026-08-14, all 15 curated tools registered: 10643 bytes
#   Budget      10643 + 15 percent = 12239, rounded up to the next 500 = 12500 bytes
#
# The headroom is for wording, not for a new tool: at ~4 bytes per token the whole surface
# costs roughly 2.7k tokens in every single session of every client. A sixteenth tool or a
# description that grows into a paragraph is supposed to trip this gate, so the decision
# gets made on purpose instead of by accident. Raising the number is allowed, but only
# together with a new measurement line above, so a regression stays attributable.
