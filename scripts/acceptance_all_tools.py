"""Phase acceptance: call every tool of the registry once, through a real MCP client over stdio.

This is the proof behind success criterion 1 of phase 1. Not a unit test and not a mock:
the script starts ``nc-mcp`` as a subprocess exactly as Claude Desktop does, speaks the
protocol over the pipe, and calls every tool of the curated set against a real Nextcloud.
A tool that is registered but broken shows up here and nowhere else, because every other
layer either skips the transport or skips the cloud.

Usage::

    docker compose -f compose.test.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_test_nc.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.test && set +a
    uv run python scripts/acceptance_all_tools.py

Exit code 0 only when every tool the running registry lists has answered. The expected set
is that list and never a copy of the names in this file: a second list here would be a
second truth about the tool surface, and this project keeps the number of tools in a test
(``tests/contract/test_tool_surface.py``) and never in a document or a script. The check
gets stronger by it rather than weaker, because a tool the registry gained and nobody
added to this run is named by it. The output is a matrix of tool name, verdict and the
first line of the answer, so a failure is attributable without a rerun.

The calls build on each other on purpose: the file uploaded in step one is the file that
``files_read``, ``unified_search``, ``search`` and ``fetch`` look for later. A tool that
answers "no hits" for an object created seconds earlier is a failure, not an empty result,
and only a chained run can tell those two apart.

Deck, Tables and Talk are the three exceptions. A board, a stack, a table, a column and a
conversation are not connector features (the server cannot create any of them, by design),
so the script uses what the instance already holds and reports the write as skipped when
there is nothing to write into. For Tables that check has two halves, because two refusals
of the connector are correct behaviour rather than a defect: a table shared without a write
permission, and a row that leaves a mandatory column empty. The script therefore only
considers tables with ``can_create`` and only writes when a text marker fits into every
mandatory column of one. For Talk the same holds with one field, ``can_send``: a read only
conversation and the changelog conversation of the account are refused by design, so a run
without a conversation this account may write into is a skip and never a failure.

Mail is the fourth of that kind and the most likely to skip of them all, because a mail
account is not something this server can create either, and a test instance usually has none.
An account list that comes back empty is a success with zero accounts, so the run says so and
walks on; the same holds one level deeper for an account without a single mailbox. Nothing is
written in this family at all: there is no ``mail_send`` to call, by design.

``fetch`` is called once per id kind that needs an object of this instance, and every one of
those ids comes out of a read of the same run: a ``fetch("mail:<number>")`` on a guessed number
would be a request about somebody's mail, and ``message:`` and ``table:`` are no different. A
read that found nothing is a SKIP whose reason says which of the two dead ends it was, because
"this instance holds no such object" and "the call before this one failed" are answered by two
different next steps and only one of them is a defect.
