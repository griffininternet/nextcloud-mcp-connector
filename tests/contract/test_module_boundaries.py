"""The boundary between the tool families, held by a gate instead of by an underscore.

A leading underscore is a promise: nobody outside this module hangs on this name, so it may be
renamed, resharpened or removed without asking around. ``tools/chatgpt.py`` broke that promise
for ``tools/talk.py`` until TOOL-19, and the damage was not a matter of style. The docstring of
the reached function carries the mitigation of T-09-21 (never ``GET /room/{token}`` with a token
that came out of a model), and a refactoring inside ``talk.py`` would have been free to take it
along, because the name said that nobody was watching. Discipline had already failed once here,
so the boundary gets a gate.

Two things make this gate trustworthy rather than decorative:

*   **It walks the tree, it does not grep the text.** ``tools/context.py`` names four private
    functions of other tool modules in prose, in the docstrings that explain which decisions it
    inherits from them. A text gate would go red on those four sentences, and the cheapest
    repair would be to delete them, which trades documentation for a green check. A docstring
    and a comment are no ``ast.Attribute`` node, so they cost nothing here, and ``context.py``
    is the second counter proof below for exactly that reason.
*   **Every finding names file, line and expression**, so a violation is a one line fix and
    never a hunt through the tree.

Why an ``ast`` gate and not ``ruff --select SLF``, measured instead of assumed (run of
2026-08-25): ``SLF`` reports three hits in ``src/`` and 53 in ``tests/``. Two of the three are an
object reaching into the internals of its own class in ``oauth/provider.py``, and all 53 in
``tests/`` are source gates doing the job they exist for. The lint rule would therefore cost two
``noqa`` lines plus a ``per-file-ignores`` entry, and after paying that it would still check a
different sentence than this file does: not "no private member anywhere" but "no module reaches
into the privates of a tool module that is not itself".
