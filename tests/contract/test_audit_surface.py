"""Contract test for the audit boundary: which parameter names may reach a log entry.

Two threats meet in this file. T-18-01 is a parameter value or a result body in the log, and
the answer to it is that ``audit/allowlist.py`` holds names alone, with the payload names on
a block list so none of them can quietly grow a value beside it one day. T-18-02 is a caller
that writes an invented parameter name into an entry, and the answer to it is that every name
of the allowlist has to exist in the schema of its own tool.

AUDIT-01 asks for the shape of ``scripts/check_tool_budget.py``: one measurement over all
registered tools, never a sample, failing as soon as a single tool crosses the boundary and
naming every finding rather than only the fact that there was one. Nothing here registers a
tool on the module singleton ``mcp``: ``tests/contract/test_tool_surface.py`` compares the
registry against a frozen literal, so a leftover test tool would turn that file red.

The proof that every tool carries the recording decorator lives in the two cases at the
bottom, added with the marker in plan 18-06. They reach through ``mcp._tool_manager``,
because that is the only place a registered tool still has its ``fn``; the boundary gate of
``tests/contract/test_module_boundaries.py`` walks ``src/mcp_connector`` and never ``tests/``,
so this is a source gate doing its job rather than a break of one.
