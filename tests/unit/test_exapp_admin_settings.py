"""The admin Declarative Settings form of BL-06 and its hook in the enable handler.

Nothing here opens a socket: the outgoing OCS registration is answered by respx, and the
lifecycle checks build their own Starlette app from ``lifecycle_routes`` exactly as
``test_exapp_lifecycle.py`` does. That file stays untouched on purpose, so plan 05-06 can
work on it without meeting this plan in the same lines.

Both forms register on the same OCS route, which is why "both were registered" is asserted
as two calls with two form ids on the wire rather than as two respx routes: two routes for
one URL would only ever be one of them.

Threats covered: T-05-05 (a ``sensitive`` field would hand the ExApp an unreadable ICrypto
blob), T-05-06 (the security hint of BL-06 lives in the field itself), T-05-04 (a failing
registration never fills the ``error`` field, which would disable the app at once) and
T-05-03 (the app secret never reaches a log record).
