"""``occ mcp_connector:audit:verify``: success criterion 3 of this phase as a command.

The check itself is tested in ``tests/unit/test_audit_store.py``. What is under test here is
everything between that check and the console of an administrator: who may reach it, which
status it answers with, and whether the sentence it prints really names the place instead of
only saying that something is wrong.

Threats covered here, in the order of the plan:

* **T-18-07** the handler reached from outside: ``x-origin-ip`` is 404, a request without the
  AppAPI headers is 401, neither says which of the two refused it, and the path appears in no
  route of ``appinfo/info.xml``.
* **T-18-03** a changed or removed entry staying unnoticed: three manipulations, each one
  made with a connection of its own past the store, and each one has to come back out of the
  answer with its chain and its number.
* **T-18-20** the verdict getting lost: ``ExAppOccService::buildCommand`` drops the body on
  any status other than 200, so every answer that got past the guard is asserted to be 200,
  the broken ones included.

The store is a real SQLite file in ``tmp_path`` for the reason the store tests give: a
manipulation is a property of the file, and a mock of the store would assert the mock.
