"""Unit tests for the OCS layer and the app detection behind graceful degradation.

Covered on purpose, all paths: the two mandatory headers (D-18), the fixture of a real
capabilities answer, an instance without Notes and without Deck, an HTML login page
instead of JSON, the app-JSON error format of Notes and Deck (pitfall 9), the exact
wording of the missing-app error (D-15) and the cache behaviour, including the proof that
the cache only saves latency and never changes an answer (D-20).

Two of them belong to Talk and are worth naming here. The app detection reads the section
``spreed`` and treats an empty array as absent, because that is what an instance sends when
Talk is installed but switched off for the asking account. And ``parse_ocs`` accepts an
envelope with the created status: the Talk send route documents 201 as its only success, and
without it a successfully sent message would read as a failure (T1).

The Mail block at the end covers the second detection channel, which is the one thing in this
module that is not read out of the capabilities answer at all: Mail has no section there, so
the navigation of the signed in user answers instead. Four states are covered (listed,
not listed, empty, not a list), plus the two properties that make the channel affordable: the
extra request happens once per cache window and only for Mail, and it does not extend the
lifetime of the snapshot it is written into.
