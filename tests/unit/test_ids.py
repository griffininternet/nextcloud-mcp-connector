"""Unit tests for the ID codec.

The codec is the only place that builds or reads prefixed IDs. A wrong prefix would
make ``fetch`` resolve a card as a note (silently), so the roundtrip property is
pinned here for all eight kinds.

``mail`` is the one kind with a guard of its own, and the tests below are written against
the reason for it rather than against its shape: a mail id that is not a number has to be
refused by this module, because the call it would otherwise reach is the most expensive of
the whole server (every full message read opens an IMAP session inside the Mail app), and
the app answers a non numeric id with 404 instead of refusing it.
