"""A1 measured: what ``GET /ocs/v2.php/apps/app_api/api/v1/users`` really answers.

This is the most dangerous assumption of phase 18 (18-RESEARCH.md §7, assumption A1). D-12
lets a missing identifier in that list remove a whole audit chain, and the list comes from
``IUserManager::searchDisplayName('')``, which is a search over display names and not a
listing of a table. Whether it answers completely on every user backend, and whether a
disabled account is in it, was written down as unmeasured. This file is where it stops being
unmeasured for the topology this project ships.

**The fail-safe does not depend on the outcome.** ``audit/accounts.py`` answers ``None`` on
every failure, on every unreadable shape and on an empty list, and ``None`` removes nothing.
So a red case here means "D-12 does not take effect in this topology", never "a chain was
deleted by mistake". That asymmetry is the point of the design, and it is why this
measurement may live in a test that not every run executes.

What is asserted, in the order the plan asks for it:

1.  the call answers 200 with a list, in the app context and with no impersonation;
2.  the list contains the known accounts of the test topology;
3.  an account that does not exist is simply absent, with no status of its own and no 404,
    which is what makes "missing from the list" the only possible signal;
4.  an account that is deleted with ``occ user:delete`` is gone from the list afterwards.

Step 4 needs a way to reach ``occ``, and that way is the compose topology itself. Where it is
not reachable the case skips and says so, and then A1 is measured for the first three
statements and unmeasured for the fourth.

Run it against the running HaRP topology::

    export HP_SHARED_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    docker compose -f compose.exapp.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.exapp && set +a
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_appapi_users_list.py -m integration -q

Without ``.env.exapp`` the ``exapp_env`` fixture skips every case and names the variable that
is missing, so the default suite stays green on a host without Docker.
