"""The permission promise proven over the whole ExApp chain (AUTH-05, D-28).

``tests/integration/test_permission_fidelity.py`` asks the same question this file asks:
does a tool refuse what a user does not own. The difference is where the credentials go and
where the identity is born. There the credentials reach our own client layer and the user id
is a field we set. Here the credentials are an ordinary Nextcloud app password that travels
to HaRP, and the identity is resolved by HaRP out of that password, injected as an AppAPI
header and only then trusted by the ExApp. The request runs the full path a real user runs:

    MCP client  ->  HaRP  ->  ExApp  ->  impersonation  ->  Nextcloud ACLs

No check in this file builds an ``httpx.BasicAuth`` for Nextcloud. In the chain cases the
only credential is each user's app password in a Basic header on the transport client, the
same header ``tests/compat/modern_client_check.py`` uses. Everything past the header is the
deployed topology: HaRP, the reverse proxy, the ExApp container and Nextcloud's own
permission check. A green row therefore cannot be explained by our client layer; it can only
be explained by the chain resolving the right user and Nextcloud enforcing the right ACLs.

The order of the checks is deliberate, so an empty answer can never pass for a boundary:

1. Guard: alice and bob are really two different accounts.
2. ``tools/list`` over the chain answers the full tool surface for both, so the chain carries.
3. Positive control (files): alice creates a file and finds it again.
4. Leak (``files_search``): bob does not find alice's file.
5. Positive control (notes) plus leak (``notes_search``): alice finds her note, bob does not.
6. Positive control and leak (``unified_search``): alice finds her content, bob finds neither.
7. Direct access (``files_read``): bob, knowing the exact path, is refused, not served content.

The Tables block at the end of the file asks the same question one layer lower, and it says
so rather than pretending otherwise. A table and its column are not connector capabilities
(create-only, threat T-08-11), so the scaffolding has to call Nextcloud directly anyway; and
the interesting boundary of that family is the impersonation seam itself, the way
``tests/integration/test_exapp_dav_matrix.py`` measures it. Both identities are therefore
built as ``Credentials`` in ``MODE_APPAPI`` with ``APP_SECRET`` as the only credential, one
object per account, and no app password is read as a credential source for those three
checks. The properties that make them proof stay the same: the positive half runs in the
same session as the negative half, and the negative half uses the real table id rather than
a guessed one.

The Talk block after it asks the same question a third time, on the same seam and with the
same two credential objects (T-09-40): alice reads the history of her own test conversation,
bob does not have it in his list at all, and bob reaches neither its history nor a send with
the real token. The comparison point there is the message count from alice's side before and
after bob's two attempts, because no tool of this server can remove a message again.

The app id ``mcp_connector`` is frozen (docs/app-id-freeze.md), so the HaRP route
``/exapps/mcp_connector/mcp`` is a constant here rather than an interpolation.

Run it against the running HaRP topology::

    export HP_SHARED_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    docker compose -p nc-mcp-exapp -f compose.exapp.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.exapp && set +a
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_permission_fidelity_exapp.py -m integration -q

# object per account, and no app password authenticates any of the three checks.

# A conversation is not a capability of this connector either (create-only, threat T-09-03),
# so the scaffolding is not built here: ``scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh`` creates alice's two test
# conversations with ``occ`` and publishes their names in ``.env.exapp``. Without them these
# checks skip with the variable named.
