"""Contacts against a real Nextcloud 34 with CardDAV (opt-in, read only).

This phase has no CardDAV write path, so these tests create nothing. They check the three
things a recorded fixture cannot answer: does the real address book path
(``addressbooks/users/<uid>/``) hold on a running instance, does the server really hand
out the two generated collections to every account, and does an account without an address
book of its own produce the error with the way out instead of an empty result.

The bootstrap prepares exactly that pair: ``occ dav:create-addressbook alice contacts``
runs for alice and never for bob.

Run it with::

    docker compose -f compose.test.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_test_nc.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.test && set +a && uv run pytest -m integration -q
