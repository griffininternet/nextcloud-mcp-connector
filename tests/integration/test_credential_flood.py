"""What a flood of invalid credentials costs, measured in Nextcloud round trips (T-05-22).

**Why this file does not measure milliseconds.** The finding of the phase research that
decides this measurement comes out of the HaRP source and is written down in the module head
of ``src/mcp_connector/oauth/throttle.py``: HaRP asks Nextcloud who the caller is for *every*
request that carries an ``Authorization`` header, on PUBLIC routes as well, and it caches that
answer for cookie sessions only. On top of that
``src/mcp_connector/oauth/verifier.py`` caches positive results only, so an invalid bearer
reaches the store on every single attempt. Measuring the response times of our own container
would therefore find them fine and miss the whole point: the load lands on Nextcloud, not
here. The number that matters is Nextcloud requests per attacker request.

**What this file is not.** It is not a promise about a throttle on ``/mcp``. That route
carries none on purpose (D-37), and it carries no ``bruteforce_protection`` in the manifest on
purpose either (T-02-21), because the OAuth discovery flow begins with a rejected request by
specification. The result of this measurement is a number for
``docs/exapp-install.md`` and a recommendation to the administrator (a rate limit in the
reverse proxy), not an argument for a code change here. A finding that speaks against D-37
belongs in the summary with its number, not in a spontaneous fix.

**The two credential forms behave in opposite ways, so each gets its own run.**

* Run A, an invalid **bearer**: one Nextcloud PHP round trip per request, and no brute force
  entry at all, because ``Session::tryTokenLogin`` returns false without counting an attempt.
* Run B, an invalid **basic**: the same round trip, plus a brute force entry per source
  address as Nextcloud sees it, which throttles everybody who shares that address.

**Two properties of the throwaway topology the measurement has to handle.**

1. ``scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh`` switches ``auth.bruteforce.protection.enabled`` off,
   because that guard is a property of an instance nobody can reach. With it off, run B would
   measure nothing and the empty counter would be an artifact of the fixture rather than a
   statement about Nextcloud. The measurement turns the guard on, and puts the previous value
   back when it is done.
2. Every ``docker compose`` call against ``compose.exapp.yml`` needs ``HP_SHARED_KEY`` in the
   environment or the file refuses to interpolate (WR-11), and the measuring process has no
   business knowing that key. The container names in that file are fixed
   (``container_name:``), so this file talks to ``docker exec`` and ``docker logs`` directly
   and names the compose equivalent in the log output for a reader who wants to repeat it.

Run it against the running HaRP topology::

    export HP_SHARED_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    docker compose -f compose.exapp.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.exapp && set +a
    uv run --no-sync pytest tests/integration/test_credential_flood.py -q -m integration
