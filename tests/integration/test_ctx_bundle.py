"""CTX-01 and CTX-02, measured: four legs, their wall clock, their requests, no side effect.

``TALK_BUDGET``, ``MAIL_BUDGET`` and ``MAX_MAIL_ACCOUNTS`` came out of plans 11-04 and 11-05 as
settings, said out loud as settings in their own comments. A setting is a number nobody has
weighed: too small means degradation in the healthy case, too large means a wall clock a client
gives up on. This file weighs them, and it is the only place in the repository where the four
legs of ``prepare_context`` run against a real Nextcloud at once.

Four things are load bearing in here, and the first two are the reason it exists.

**The measurement never uses the route it measures.** ``unread`` and ``unread_mention`` of the
target conversation are read through ``talk_browse(level="conversations")``, before and after
``fetch("message:...")``, and never through the context route that ``fetch`` walks. The rule
comes from plan 10-08: an operation cannot testify about itself, and a read marker moved by the
very call under test would be invisible to a measurement taken with that call. The freedom from
side effects of that route is a property of spreed 24.0.4 (``waitForNewMessages`` with timeout
0, ``markNotificationsAsRead: false``, and ``updateLastReadMessage`` never reached), which is a
sentence read out of somebody else's source code until it is measured here.

**Every id comes from a real search hit.** Not one ``fetch`` in this file is called with an id
this file made up. A guessed message id reads a neighbouring message and a guessed table id
reads a foreign table, and neither failure is loud (threats T-11-01, T-11-39). When the search
of this instance carries no hit of a kind, the measurement is a **skip with a true reason**, and
the reason names the terms that were tried.

**This file creates nothing.** No table, no message, no mail, no conversation: every number
below comes from what ``scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh`` and the Nextcloud first run already put
there. There is therefore no ``finally`` that cleans up, because a ``finally`` without content
is a promise without cover. The one thing this run could change is exactly what measurement 5
measures, and the last test of the file reads the conversation counters once more so the end
state is measured rather than assumed.

**A foreign provider error is not a failed leg.** The Deck comment provider of this instance
answers 500 every few runs, and the search leg passes that on as its own ``degraded`` entry,
which is what it is built to do. The assertions below are therefore about entries that say a
leg missed its budget, never about an empty ``degraded`` list, because an assertion on
emptiness would turn somebody else's flaky app into a red measurement of ours.

The topology this was measured against (six containers, three apps, one Nextcloud)::

    nc-mcp-exapp-nc  nc_app_mcp_connector  nc-mcp-exapp-harp
    nc-mcp-exapp-caddy  nc-mcp-exapp-registry  nc-mcp-exapp-greenmail
    Nextcloud 34.0.3, mail 5.11.1, spreed 24.0.4, tables 2.2.2

Run it against the running HaRP topology::

    docker compose -p nc-mcp-exapp -f compose.exapp.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.exapp && set +a
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_ctx_bundle.py -m integration -s

The rows it prints with ``-s`` are the deliverable: they go into
``.planning/phases/11-b-ndelung-budget-und-release-0-1-6/11-06-MEASUREMENTS.md`` verbatim, and
the four budget comments in ``src/mcp_connector/tools/context.py`` quote them.

    A divergence is only counted when one window of the history settles it, and the two

    ``talk_browse(level="messages")`` is safe to use as the instrument here: its client sends
    ``READ_ONLY_PARAMS``, so ``setReadMarker`` and ``markNotificationsAsRead`` are both 0 and
