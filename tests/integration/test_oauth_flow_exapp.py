"""The OAuth connection proven over the whole ExApp chain (AUTH-02, AUTH-03, SC 4, SC 5).

``tests/unit/test_oauth_abuse.py`` asks these questions in process, against an application
assembled the way ``entry_exapp`` assembles it. This file asks them again where nothing can
be arranged: the token is issued by the running container, it travels to HaRP inside a real
``Authorization`` header, HaRP resolves what it can and hands the request on, and the answer
is what Nextcloud's own permission check allows::

    MCP client  ->  reverse proxy  ->  HaRP  ->  ExApp container  ->  Nextcloud ACLs

The four questions, in the order in which a failure of one makes the next meaningless:

1. A token that came out of the flow serves a tool call over the whole chain.
2. The same token still serves one after the container was restarted. This is the proof
   that the store is on the volume and that the data key survives with it: the key lives in
   Nextcloud's ExApp configuration, and a restart that could not read it back would answer
   every request with a 500 (plan 03-02, pitfall 12).
3. Two accounts stay two accounts: bob's token reaches nothing of alice's, in both
   directions, and alice finds her own content in the same run.
4. A revocation is a 401 with the same pointer an anonymous request gets, and a whole new
   connection can be built afterwards.

Plus the one measurement that only exists at a running instance: a series of bearers this
server never issued ends in 429 with ``Retry-After`` on the token endpoint, and the working
connection is untouched by it, because the throttle never sits on the MCP route (D-37).

The app id ``mcp_connector`` is frozen (docs/app-id-freeze.md), so the route is a literal
here rather than an interpolation. The whole client half of the flow, including the two
steps a browser normally performs, lives in ``scripts/oauth_flow_check.py`` and is imported
from there: one implementation, used by the repeatable run and by these checks.

Run it against the running HaRP topology::

    export HP_SHARED_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    docker compose -p nc-mcp-exapp -f compose.exapp.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.exapp && set +a
    uv run --no-sync pytest tests/integration/test_oauth_flow_exapp.py -m integration -q

Without that topology the default suite stays green: ``addopts`` deselects the integration
marker and the fixture below skips with the missing variable named.
