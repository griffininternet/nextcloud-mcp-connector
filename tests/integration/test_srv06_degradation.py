"""SRV-06: all three new families disappear cleanly when their app is gone, measured.

There is no model for this file in the repository. No other test switches an app off and
restarts the instance, which is why the frame comes from ``test_exapp_mail_reach.py`` and
everything past the frame is new. Three things about it are load bearing, and the first of
them is the reason this file exists at all.

**Why the restart is mandatory.** Measured on 2026-08-24 against this topology: after
``occ app:disable mail`` the route ``core/navigation/apps`` still answers with a ``mail``
entry and ``account/list`` still answers 200. Only a restart of the Nextcloud makes both of
them go away. A degradation test without that restart claims the missing-app branch works and
has never once seen it: it is green because the app is still answering. The same finding has
been in ``STATE.md`` for the capabilities since phase 1 ("an app disabled with occ stays
visible in /cloud/capabilities until the Nextcloud restarts"), and the research of this phase
measured it for the navigation channel separately, because Mail is detected there and not in
the capabilities (trap 1).

**What this file costs and why that is accepted.** Three disable/restore cycles are six
restarts of a Nextcloud, which is minutes rather than seconds. It therefore runs under
``-m integration`` only and never in the default selection, and it is the one proof success
criterion 5 of this phase accepts. Each family is measured **once** per session and the rows
are memoised, the way ``test_exapp_mail_reach.py`` memoises its four ways: the assertions
below read recorded rows instead of each triggering a cycle of its own.

**The cleanup guarantee.** Every app that is switched off is switched back on and the instance
is restarted again, in a ``finally``, whether the measurement succeeded or not. The end state
is then **measured** rather than assumed: :func:`test_the_instance_is_back_the_way_it_was`
reads ``occ app:list`` and calls all three tools again. Leaving a throwaway topology in a half
state is the one side effect this file must not have, because everything else in the
integration suite runs against it.

On ``occ`` and Git Bash: this process talks to the daemon with a fixed argv
(``docker exec -u www-data ... php occ``), so no shell rewrites anything and the relative
``occ`` spelling is resolved inside the container. A reader who reproduces the same call by
hand from a Git Bash prompt with the absolute path needs ``MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1``, otherwise the
shell turns ``/var/www/html/occ`` into a Windows path and php answers "Could not open input
file". The note is here because the reproduction line is the one people copy.

Run it against the running HaRP topology::

    docker compose -p nc-mcp-exapp -f compose.exapp.yml up -d --wait
    bash scripts/bootstrap_exapp.sh
    set -a && . ./.env.exapp && set +a
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_srv06_degradation.py -m integration -s

The six rows it prints with ``-s`` are the deliverable: family, state, whether a restart lay
in between, and the first sentence of the answer.
