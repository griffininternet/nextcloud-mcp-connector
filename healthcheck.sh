# Docker HEALTHCHECK of the ExApp container (T-02-25).
#
# AppAPI reads the container health before it sends the first heartbeat, and a container
# without a healthcheck counts as healthy, which hides a failed start until the fifteen
# minute deploy timeout expires. So the probe has to be honest about both transports.
#
# Behind HaRP the process listens on a unix socket and there is no TCP port at all;
# HP_SHARED_KEY is the switch, the very same one entry_exapp.main uses. A probe against
# 127.0.0.1:APP_PORT would be permanently red there, and AppAPI would sit out its timeout
# on a container that is in fact serving. Without HaRP the socket does not exist and the
# port is the only way in.
#
# The exit code of curl is the exit code of this script: exec, no wrapper, no retry. The
# retries belong to the HEALTHCHECK instruction, not here.

# Is frpc still running? Only asked on the HaRP path, where it is the transport (WR-05).
# start.sh launches it as an unsupervised background child of PID 1 and configures
# `loginFailExit = false`, so a dead or never logged in frpc leaves uvicorn answering
# happily on the socket while HaRP has no backend at all: the container reports healthy and
# every request from outside is a 503. /proc instead of pgrep, because the image carries no
# procps and one probe is not worth a package.
